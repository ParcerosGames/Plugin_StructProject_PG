# STRUCTURE PLUGIN IN PROJECT üöÄ

This plugin will help users to organize their objects in a hierarchy in a more professional way, it will also be adapted for project panel files.

The functionalities that it would have would be several in the long term, among them, the change of color of the objects in hierarchy, adding icons to said objects, among other functions

### **GENERAL** üìã
Maintaining order in our activities is something that we all must do for a better operation, and in our projects it must be a priority, since it helps us control everything in a much easier way, this plugin addresses those small problems of all Unity developers who do not know how to name their projects, which nomenclature would be the right one for that project ?, if it is a 2D platform project, what should I use ?, if it is a third person shooter, or even, if it is a VR project of the industrial sector.

The solution is already in your hands, stop thinking about that architecture, because you already have the solution.

### **FIRST STAGE:** üõ†Ô∏è
#### structure in the hierarchy section.

Whenever we create a project in unity, it comes by default with the lighting component, camera, among others; In this first stage, we are going to approach a correct structure to generate an adequate order in the hierarchy section.

* Project information panel: panel with the respective information of the project, its updates and information of its creators
* Selection panels for different project structures: When you want to create a structure for the hierarchy section, there will be different options, depending on the project being created, from 2D, VR, AAA, or even AR
* Options panel: When selecting the type of structure that you want to create, the options for the font you want to use appear, as well as the type of font, either bolt, italic, etc.
